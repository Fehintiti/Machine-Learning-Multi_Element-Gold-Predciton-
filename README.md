# Introduction
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building a machine learning model to predict a target variable. The model is fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning, and its performance is evaluated.

# Data Preprocessing
We imported necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn. We then read the data into a pandas dataframe using the read_csv function. We removed special characters from the data using the str.replace() method. We also adjusted the data index using the set_index() method.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
We carried out multivariate analysis to identify correlations between variables. We used scatterplots, heatmaps, and boxplots to visualize the relationships between variables. We also determined the baseline accuracy for the dataset, which was the percentage of the most common class.

# Dealing with Imbalanced Data
We noticed that the dataset was imbalanced, with one class having significantly more samples than the other. We used both oversampling and undersampling techniques to balance the dataset. We split the data into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.

# Model Building and Fine Tuning
We built several machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine. We carried out cross-validation across the dataset to get the accuracy of various models for both the undersample and oversample data. We found that random forest had the most accuracy for the dataset.

We then fine-tuned the hyperparameters of the random forest model using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters and estimators. We plotted out the classification report to evaluate the model's performance on the test set. We also plotted a bar chart to get the most important features in the model.

# Conclusion
In summary, this project carried out exploratory data analysis on a dataset and built a machine learning model to predict a target variable. The model was fine-tuned using hyperparameter tuning, and its performance was evaluated. The random forest model had the best accuracy for the dataset. The results of this project can be used for further analysis and decision-making in the relevant domain. #machinelearning #datascience #goldprediction #randomforest #gridsearchcv #classificationreport #barplot #undersampling #oversampling
